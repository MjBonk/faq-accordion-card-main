## Overview
I chose to make this challenge without javascript purely because i don't know javascript yet :) 
I made the accordion using checkboxes, the catch is that you can only (as far as i know) press the text to ”check it”/open the accordion tab. 

I also would like the accordion content height to adapt to the text within it but i can't make a transition from height:0; to height:auto; 
EDIT: I figuerd it out using grid instead of height so the content goes from grid-template-rows: 0; to 1fr! :)

Its my first time working with svgs, in the desktop version their positioned absolute which made the responsiveness really ugly lol. 

I will definitely revisit this one when I have more knowledge and the energy to fix it :)
